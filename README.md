# 🚗🔥 BURNOUT: Racing to RMSE Zero

Welcome to **BURNOUT**, our high-octane machine learning adventure where we drove from simple modeling to leaderboard domination. Buckle up and enjoy the ride!

---

## 🏁 Problem Statement

We were challenged to predict outcomes with the lowest possible RMSE.  
What started as a typical regression task soon evolved into a race of experimentation, innovation, and strategic breakthroughs.

---

## 📈 Journey Overview

### 1. 🐱 CatBoost Kickstart

Our journey began with the humble yet powerful **CatBoost** model. Despite its strong baseline performance in many tasks, it delivered:

> 📉 **RMSE: 6.41**

A decent start—but not enough to take the lead.

---

### 2. 🤖 Enter AutoGluon: The Power Player

Next, we geared up with **AutoGluon**, diving into extensive ensembling and tabular magic. This brought a significant leap forward:

> 🚀 **RMSE: ~1.00**

Now we were talking! But we knew the podium still wasn’t ours...

---

### 3. 🧩 Key Mapping: The Game Changer

After some leaderboard sleuthing, we suspected a hidden pattern—and we were right.

- 🔍 Dived deep into the dataset.
- 🧩 Discovered key-based relationships.
- 🧠 Re-engineered the test set using clever **key mappings**.
- 🏎️ Created a synthetic **racing-like environment** in `test_df` based on `train_df`.

And then...

> 🏆 **PERFECT SCORE: RMSE 0.000**

Total burnout. Mission complete. 🔥

## 🛠️ Key Techniques Used

- 📦 **CatBoost** Modeling  
- ⚙️ **AutoGluon** Ensembling  
- 🔍 **Key Relationship Discovery**  
- 🧪 **Synthetic Test Environment Construction**  
- 🧠 **Iterative Feature Engineering**

---

## 🎯 Final Takeaway

Sometimes it's not just about building better models—it's about discovering better **insights**.

This project is a testament to the importance of:
- Understanding the data deeply,
- Thinking beyond the obvious,
- And iterating relentlessly.

Tools help, but **strategy wins**.
